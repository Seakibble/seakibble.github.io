                                    <h3>Invasion: The Year of Curses</h3>
                                    <p>A project for a Dungeons & Dragons game, this is a kingdom management simulator. The players attempt to prevent their dwarven hold from collapsing over the course of a year. Each month, three events occur, and the party must decide how to resolve them - who should deal with each event, and what decisions will they make. The outcomes have consequences for the status of the kingdom.</p>
                                    <p>It was designed as an aid for me to use at my own table, rather than as a standalone product for others to play with, but it's one of the most impressive individual projects I've worked on. It features sound effects, an event deck (with chains of events that form branching stories), and honestly just some very nice styling. I love how this turned out!</p>

                                    <p>Another attempt in a long sequence of overly-ambitious platformers, Galactic Agent is something I'm simultaneously incrediby proud of and somewhat disappointed with. It's essentially a demo, featuring the first two rooms of what would be a fully-fledged metroidvania-style game. It stands incomplete, as I ran out of steam once I solved the technical challenges. I think as a person, I'm more motivated by development challenges than by content.</p>
                                    <p>It features a soundtrack (composed by me) and sound effects, enemies, room transitions, and an opening cutscene. There's a ton more I could do with this, so I'll probably get back to it at some point.</p>

                                    <p>One of my hobbies is running Dungeons & Dragons. I wanted to make a tool that could be used to construct sentences in various languages. David (a friend of mine) and I designed the languages. The technical challenges that came up with parsing the input and mapping the output were very interesting. I had a lot of fun making this.</p>
