            "If memory serves, I learned this method for poaching eggs from Gordon Ramsey, and it's never let me down. The trick is to whisk as fast as you can and immediately drop the eggs in. If you wait too long, the vortex will fade and the eggs will not stay together."

It remains to this day the best chilli recipe I know, and it always reminds me of my Dad and the times we cooked it together. Invariably, he would forget one of the ingredients. This was such a consistent happenstance that it became a running joke that forgetting an ingredient was tradition. As such, each time he made it, it was a little bit different. Regardless, it always had a certian signature flavour that can't be beaten by any other chilli recipe.",

            "Every person I've ever met has claimed that chilli should be eaten with rice. They are all wrong. The correct way to eat chilli is with fusilli pasta. This is because that's the way Dad always served this chilli recipe, and if you disagree, you simply haven't experienced the majesty of chilli with fusilli. The chilli gets locked into all the twists, and it's just so delicious! Try it! You'll never go back!",
            "A lazy alternative to pasta or rice that I occasionally restort to is na'an bread. I've had a lot of issues in the past overeating because I underestimated the amount of pasta I was making. I've found portion control to be a lot easier with na'an.",
            "One of the best things about chilli is that it's a fantastic freezer meal. When I make a batch, I typically eat leftovers for a day or two, then freeze the rest. 2-3 serving spoons-worth in a ziplock bag is usually about a portion for me, and I easily end up with 6 or more bags.",

As leftovers, the pasta gets soggy and unpleasant very quickly. Easiest way to do it is separate the portion of the soup you intend to eat as you make it, then cook the amount of tortellini you want in that. Then you can store the pasta-less remainder in the fridge or freezer, as desired."
